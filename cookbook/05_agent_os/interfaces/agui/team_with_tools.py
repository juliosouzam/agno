"""Team With Tools
================

Coordinate-mode Team exposing an ``external_execution=True`` frontend tool
through the AG-UI interface. The team-level ``generate_haiku`` tool is
registered server-side and the AG-UI router pauses the run so the AG-UI
client (CopilotKit, the AG-UI dojo) executes the tool on the user's
machine and posts the result back to resume the run.

``add_history_to_context=True`` with ``db=InMemoryDb()`` so the team
remembers prior turns and varies ``image_name`` / ``gradient`` choices
across consecutive same-theme prompts. The AG-UI router strips client-sent
history, so without a db the team would start fresh on every turn.

Tool schema (``japanese``, ``english``, ``image_name``, ``gradient``)
matches the AG-UI dojo's ``tool_based_generative_ui`` page so the
frontend's React render handler can pick up every field.
``external_execution_silent=True`` suppresses the "Team run paused"
status message while the frontend executes the tool.

Team-mode external-execution over AG-UI relies on the
``TeamRunPausedEvent`` handling, ``set_external_execution_result()``
resume path, and team-side silent-tool filter that shipped with the
AG-UI client-tools support in #8565 (and the #8364 interface split),
both on ``main``. This cookbook runs on current ``main`` as-is.

# tool registry (parse_tools) drops the forwarded frontend definition on
# name collision (server-side wins). Do NOT remove this stub thinking it is
# redundant: without it the team has no pause source and the dojo will
# never receive TOOL_CALL_* events.
